# VS Code

The extensions and themes are controlled by Syncing my settings to my GitHub account. This way I don't have to deal with remembering to update everything and then git it to the repo

You can also do this by going to the [Setting Sync page](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync) in the VS Code website
